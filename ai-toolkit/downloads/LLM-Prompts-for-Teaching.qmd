title: "Using LLMs to Simplify Your Teaching: A Curated Prompt Guide"
---

A practical collection of prompts and workflows for lecturers and students, drawn from classroom-tested approaches and adapted for higher education contexts. These work across Claude, Gemini, NotebookLM, and other LLM tools.

---

## How to Get Started

1. Pick a specific task you need to complete (a quiz, a study guide, a rubric).
2. Provide the AI with your unit level, topic, and any constraints.
3. Paste your existing content (slides, notes, rubric, reading).
4. Let the AI handle the formatting and heavy lifting.
5. Review, refine, and make it your own before it reaches students.

**A note on privacy:** Never paste student names or identifying information into any AI tool. Use initials or anonymised identifiers. Use your institutional account where possible.

## Part 1: For Lecturers

These prompts are designed to save you time on the repetitive parts of teaching so you can focus on what matters: the students.

### 1. The 1-Page Study Guide Creator

**When to use it:** You have a full slide deck or set of lecture notes and need a clean student handout fast.

**Prompt:**

> Turn this into a 1-page student study guide for [UNIT LEVEL]: clear headings, key bullet notes, 8 key terms (student-friendly definitions), and 10 self-check questions with an answer key. Keep it concise and classroom-ready. CONTENT: [PASTE SLIDES OR NOTES]

---

### 2. 3-Level Exit Tickets

**When to use it:** You want quick formative checks for mixed readiness levels.

**Prompt:**

> Create 3 exit tickets from this lesson for [UNIT LEVEL]: Easy / On-Level / Challenge. Each ticket: 3 questions + answer key. Align to this objective: [OBJECTIVE]. LESSON CONTENT: [PASTE]

---

### 3. The "5-in-1" Lesson Workflow

**When to use it:** You need an entire suite of materials from a single set of lesson notes. This is the ultimate weekend time-saver.

**Steps:**

1. Open your preferred LLM and paste your raw lesson notes or outline.
2. Ask for 5 specific deliverables: student notes, a quiz, an exit ticket, a tiered activity, and a summary.
3. Review and polish the generated drafts before class.

**Prompt:**

> Using the lesson content below, generate the following 5 items for a [UNIT LEVEL] class:
> 1. A 1-page set of student notes with key terms highlighted
> 2. A 10-question quiz (mix of multiple choice and short answer) with answer key
> 3. A 3-question exit ticket
> 4. A tiered activity with Support, Core, and Extend versions
> 5. A 3-sentence lesson summary suitable for an LMS post
>
> LESSON CONTENT: [PASTE]

---

### 4. Differentiation Pack: Support / Core / Extend

**When to use it:** You need scaffolds and extensions without rewriting your whole lesson.

**Prompt:**

> I'm teaching [STANDARD/SKILL] to [UNIT LEVEL]. Generate a differentiation pack with: Support (scaffolded), Core (on-level), Extend (higher-order). Include directions, examples, and a quick check for understanding.

---

### 5. Make Any Text Accessible (ELL / Inclusion)

**When to use it:** You need simplified versions of complex readings without losing core meaning.

**Prompt:**

> Rewrite this passage into 2 versions for [UNIT LEVEL]: Simplified and On-Grade. Add 10 vocab words with student-friendly definitions, 1 sentence frame per word, and 5 comprehension questions + answer key. PASSAGE: [PASTE]

---

### 6. Grounded Study Guides with NotebookLM

**When to use it:** You want AI-generated materials that are strictly based on your own sources, with no hallucinated content or outside information.

**Steps:**

1. Upload your source documents (PDFs, slides, readings) to a new NotebookLM notebook.
2. Use the prompt: "Create a student study guide with key takeaways, key terms, and 10 self-check questions."
3. Optionally generate a "2-minute review script" to read aloud in class.

**Best practices for NotebookLM:**

- Keep it to 1 unit per notebook (avoid mixing units).
- Name notebooks like teacher files: "ISYS6020 - AI Innovation - Week 3".
- Add your top 3-5 core sources first as anchor documents.
- Set constraints upfront: time limits, reading level, required supports.
- Demand citations: ask for "quote + page/section for every claim."
- Save reusable prompts as "Starter Prompts" inside the notebook.
- Always fact-check: ask "Show where you got that" and "What's missing from my sources?"

**When to use it:** You have drafted an assessment brief and want to check if students will actually understand it.

## Part 2: For Students (Share These With Your Class)

These prompts are designed to help students use AI as a study partner rather than a shortcut. Frame these as "here's something you can try" to build good AI habits.

## Tips for Getting Better Results from Any LLM

- **Be specific about the output format.** Ask for tables, bullet points, numbered lists, or specific word counts.
- **Set constraints upfront.** Grade level, time available, reading level, number of items.
- **Paste your actual content.** The more context you give, the more relevant the output.
- **Iterate.** Treat the first output as a draft. Ask follow-up questions to refine.
- **Ground it in your materials.** Tools like NotebookLM keep responses anchored to your sources.
- **Demand citations.** Ask "Where did you get that?" to catch hallucinations.
- **Think conversation, not delegation.** The AI is a collaborator, not a replacement for your expertise.
