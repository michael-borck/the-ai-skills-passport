title: "The AI Landscape: Which Tool Do I Actually Need?"
---

## Start Here, Not With the Tools

Before we talk about models, platforms, and features, one thing matters more than all of them:

**Every AI tool is built on the same foundation: the prompt.**

Whether you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or a local open-source model, the core interaction is the same: you write a prompt, the AI responds, you refine. The chat interface is where it all happens.

If you learn to prompt well, to structure your thinking, iterate effectively, and evaluate output critically, you can move between tools with ease. The tool is secondary. The skill is primary.

So if you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of AI tools available: relax. Learn the fundamentals (see the **CRAFT Prompting Framework** and **Conversation, Not Delegation** in this toolkit), and the specific tools become interchangeable.

---

## The Chat Interface: Where Everything Starts

All major AI tools share the same basic interaction model:

1. You type a prompt
2. The AI generates a response
3. You refine, follow up, or start again

This conversational interface is the foundation of everything else, whether you're writing, analysing, coding, creating images, or building automated workflows. Master the conversation, and the rest follows.

### Different Providers, Different Personalities

Each AI provider has a slightly different "feel":

| Provider | Known For |
|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | Versatile, conversational, widely adopted |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | Thoughtful, careful, strong on nuance and long documents |
| **Gemini** (Google) | Integrated with Google ecosystem, strong on search and multimodal |
| **Copilot** (Microsoft) | Embedded in Microsoft 365, good for workplace tasks |

These differences are real but subtle. Each model has its own tone, phrasing, and tendencies. You may find one "clicks" with how you think more than another. That's fine. Use what feels productive.

**The important thing:** the core prompting skills transfer across all of them.

## Understanding Model Tiers

### Frontier Models

These are the most capable, most expensive models from major providers:

- **GPT-4o / GPT-4.5** (OpenAI)
- **Claude Opus / Sonnet** (Anthropic)
- **Gemini Ultra / Pro** (Google)

They excel at complex reasoning, nuanced writing, and multi-step analysis. They're available through paid subscriptions (typically $20–30/month) or API access.

**Do you need a frontier model?** For everyday brainstorming, drafting, and iteration, often not. The free tiers are surprisingly capable for most tasks. Frontier models matter when you need deep reasoning, very long document processing, or high-stakes accuracy.

### Free Tiers

Every major provider offers a free tier:

| Provider | Free Access |
|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | Free tier with GPT-4o mini |
| **Claude** | Free tier with usage limits |
| **Gemini** | Free tier, generous limits, integrated with Google |
| **Copilot** | Free tier in Bing and Windows |

For most exploration and learning, the free tiers are more than sufficient. Start here.

### A Note on FOMO

There's constant pressure to have the latest model. "GPT-5 just dropped!", "Claude's new version is incredible!", "Gemini can now do X!"

Take a breath.

If you're having conversations with AI, brainstorming, iterating, thinking together, you don't need the latest and greatest. You need a tool that helps you think. Last month's model does that just fine.

The goal is to **amplify your thinking, not chase benchmarks**. A thoughtful conversation with a "lesser" model will outperform a lazy prompt to the most advanced model every time.

## Beyond Chat: Specialised AI Tools

### NotebookLM (Google)

A research and note-taking tool that lets you upload documents and have AI conversations grounded in your own materials.

- **What it does:** Upload PDFs, docs, web pages, YouTube videos. Ask questions. AI answers based *only* on your uploaded sources, reducing hallucination
- **Standout feature:** Generates podcast-style audio summaries of your documents
- **Best for:** Literature review, research synthesis, understanding complex documents, study aids
- **Cost:** Free (Google account required)

### AI for Images and Art

- **DALL-E** (OpenAI, via ChatGPT). Text-to-image generation
- **Midjourney.** High-quality artistic image generation
- **Adobe Firefly.** AI image generation integrated with Creative Cloud
- **Google Imagen** (via Gemini). Google's image generation

**Use cases in higher education:** Creating teaching materials, generating diagrams, visualising concepts, designing presentations.

### AI for Music and Audio

- **Suno.** Text-to-music generation (surprisingly good)
- **NotebookLM Audio.** Document-to-podcast conversion
- **ElevenLabs.** Text-to-speech with natural voices

### AI for Video

- **Runway.** AI video generation and editing
- **Synthesia.** AI avatar videos for presentations and training
- **Google Veo** (via Gemini). Google's video generation

### AI for Code and App Development

- **GitHub Copilot.** AI-assisted coding in your editor
- **Claude Code.** AI-assisted development from the command line
- **Cursor.** AI-native code editor
- **Replit.** Browser-based coding with AI assistance
- **Google AI Studio.** Prototype AI applications

### Google's Free Tier (Worth Knowing)

Google offers an unusually generous free tier through **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini**:

- Chat with Gemini models (free)
- NotebookLM (free)
- Image generation via Gemini (free)
- AI Studio for prototyping (free tier with API access)
- Integration with Google Docs, Sheets, Slides

If you're exploring and don't want to pay for subscriptions, Google's ecosystem is a strong starting point.

## Running AI Locally

You don't have to send your data to the cloud. Open-source models can run on your own machine.

### Why Run Locally?

- **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your computer
- **No subscription:** Free after initial setup
- **Offline:** Works without internet
- **Control:** Choose exactly which model to use

### How to Get Started

**Ollama.** The simplest way to run open-source models locally.

- Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
- Run a model: `ollama run llama3` (or mistral, phi, gemma, etc.)
- Chat in your terminal. That's it

**LM Studio.** A desktop app with a visual interface for running local models.

- Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
- Browse and download models from a built-in catalogue
- Chat interface similar to ChatGPT, but entirely local

### Popular Open-Source Models

| Model | Developer | Strengths |
|---|---|---|
| **Llama 3** | Meta | General-purpose, very capable |
| **Mistral / Mixtral** | Mistral AI | Efficient, good reasoning |
| **Phi** | Microsoft | Small but surprisingly capable |
| **Gemma** | Google | Lightweight, good for experimentation |

### Honest Limitations

- Local models are generally less capable than frontier cloud models
- They require a reasonably powerful computer (8GB+ RAM minimum, 16GB+ recommended)
- Setup requires some technical comfort
- No internet access for the model (can't search or browse)

**Best for:** Privacy-sensitive work, experimentation, learning how AI works under the hood, situations where you can't use cloud services.

## A Note for Staff: Data Governance Matters

Before using any AI tool with work-related data, consider:

**Use your institution's enterprise version when available.** Enterprise versions of Copilot, ChatGPT, and others typically have:

- Data protection agreements with the university
- Assurance that your data isn't used for training
- Compliance with institutional privacy policies
- Audit trails and administrative controls

**What NOT to put into free-tier AI tools:**

- Student names, IDs, or personal information
- Unpublished research data
- HR or personnel information
- Financial or sensitive institutional data
- Anything covered by ethics approval or confidentiality agreements

**When in doubt:** Use the enterprise version, use a local model, or anonymise the data first.

For detailed guidance, see the **Ethics, Data Governance & Integrity** and **Secure & Sustainable AI Use** guides in this toolkit.

## The Landscape Changes Fast (And That's Okay)

New models launch monthly. Features change. Pricing shifts. Today's breakthrough is tomorrow's baseline.

This can feel overwhelming. But here's the thing: **the fundamentals don't change.**

- Prompting well matters more than which model you use
- Conversation and iteration beat one-shot queries on any model
- Human judgement remains essential regardless of AI capability
- Privacy and ethics apply to every tool

Learn the fundamentals. Pick a tool that works for you. Use it well. When something better comes along, your skills transfer.

The AI landscape is a buffet, not a race. Sample what's useful. Ignore the hype. Focus on what helps you think better.
