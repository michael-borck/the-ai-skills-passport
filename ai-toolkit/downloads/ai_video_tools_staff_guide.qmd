## Why AI Video?

AI tools now let you create polished video lessons without a camera, studio, or editing skills. You write a script (or upload existing materials), and the AI handles visuals, voiceover, subtitles, transitions, and music. A lesson that used to take hours to film and edit can be ready in minutes.

**Important caveat:** These tools work best for short videos (1–3 minutes). They can produce factual errors, awkward visuals, and mismatched tone. Every video needs your review before it reaches students. Think of them as a drafting assistant that gives you a strong starting point, and you make it yours.

## What You Can Do

| Use Case | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Script to Video** | Paste a lesson script and get a complete video with voiceover, subtitles, music, and visuals |
| **Avatar Presenter** | A digital presenter reads your script with realistic lip-syncing, great when you don't want to be on camera |
| **Animated Explainers** | Turn abstract concepts into step-by-step visual walkthroughs with diagrams and motion graphics |
| **Multilingual Versions** | Generate the same lesson in multiple languages without re-recording |
| **Convert Existing Materials** | Upload a PowerPoint, PDF, or notes and let the AI transform them into video |
| **Interactive Video** | Embed quiz questions, polls, or prompts at specific points so students engage as they watch |
| **Flipped Classroom** | Create lesson videos for students to watch before class, freeing up contact time for discussion and practice |
| **Student Projects** | Students use the same tools for research presentations, topic explainers, or book reports |

## Suggested Workflow

```
1. Write your script     →  Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft and refine
2. Generate the video    →  Use InVideo AI, Synthesia, or Google Vids
3. Review and edit       →  Watch it, fix errors, adjust tone
4. Add interactivity     →  Use EdPuzzle to embed questions
5. Publish               →  Upload to your LMS or share directly
```

## Practical Tips

1. **Script first, tool second.** The quality of your input directly shapes the output. Draft your lesson script before opening any tool.

2. **Keep it short.** Aim for 1–3 minutes per video. AI tools lose coherence in longer clips (characters change appearance, scenes repeat, lighting shifts). Break a 15-minute lesson into five short videos.

3. **Always watch before sharing.** AI-generated video can include factual errors, odd visuals, or inappropriate tone. Review everything.

4. **Use avatars strategically.** They work well for instructions, procedures, and step-by-step content. They're less effective for emotional or personal topics where your own presence matters more.

5. **Repurpose what you have.** Don't start from scratch. Upload existing PowerPoints, lecture notes, or PDFs and let the AI convert them.

6. **Combine tools.** No single tool does everything well. A two- or three-tool workflow (script → video → interactivity) covers the full process.

7. **Check institutional policies.** Verify approved tools and data privacy requirements before creating content, especially anything involving student-related data.

8. **Start free.** CapCut, FlexClip, Google Vids, and Canva all have free tiers. Test before committing to a subscription.

9. **Don't overdo it.** AI video supplements your teaching; it doesn't replace you. Students still prefer and benefit from real interaction. Use video for specific purposes and keep yourself at the centre of the learning experience.
