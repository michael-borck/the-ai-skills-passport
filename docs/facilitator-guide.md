## Facilitation Tips

### Opening (10 min)
- Share a brief personal story about your own AI use/learning
- Ask: "What's one question you have about AI in your work?"
- Capture themes on whiteboard. Revisit at end

### During Activities (60 min)
- Let participants work through SPA sections
- Walk the room, offer help, spark discussion
- Pull group together to share interesting findings
- Don't rush. Depth beats coverage

### "In Your Context" Discussion (15 min)
- Split into role groups (Teaching / Research / Admin) if mixed
- Each group identifies 2-3 specific applications
- Brief share-back (1 min each group)

### Closing (10 min)
- Revisit opening questions. What's been answered?
- Point to AI Toolkit for ongoing reference
- Show how to mark experience complete (My Passport)
- Mention AI in 5 for continued engagement

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't use AI" | That's fine. This is about understanding what's possible and making informed choices |
| "This is overwhelming" | Focus on one technique or idea to try. You don't need everything today |
| "Won't AI replace us?" | AI augments expertise. The goal is to be more capable, not replaced |
| "My discipline is different" | Great. What would work for your context? You're the expert there |
| Technology not working | Have offline discussion ready; the conversation is valuable without the SPA |

---

## After the Workshop

- [ ] Ensure participants know how to mark completion
- [ ] Share link to AI Toolkit for reference
- [ ] Follow up with AI in 5 enrollment option
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't for next time
