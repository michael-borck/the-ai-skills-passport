# Copilot & Agent Setup Guide

**Purpose:** Create a persistent AI agent that evaluates proposals or performs structured analysis using defined frameworks

---

## Option 1: Microsoft Copilot Studio (Recommended for Organisations)

### Prerequisites:
- Microsoft 365 account with Copilot Studio access
- OR Microsoft Copilot Pro subscription

### Setup Steps:

#### 1. Access Copilot Studio
- Go to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/
- Sign in with your Microsoft account
- Click "Create" → "New Copilot"

#### 2. Configure Agent Basics
- **Name:** Give your agent a descriptive name (e.g. "AI Investment Analyser")
- **Description:** Briefly describe what the agent does and what frameworks it uses
- **Icon:** Choose something appropriate to the domain

#### 3. Set Agent Instructions

In the "Instructions" field, define your agent's role, context, and evaluation framework. A well-structured agent prompt typically includes:

- **Role:** What the agent is and what it does
- **Context:** Key facts about your organisation relevant to the task
- **Frameworks:** The specific criteria or models the agent should apply
- **Output format:** The structured format for responses
- **Disposition:** How the agent should approach decisions (e.g. "be critical, find problems")

**Example structure:**

```
You are a [role] for [your organisation].

ROLE: [What the agent does — one sentence]

ORGANISATIONAL CONTEXT:
- [Key fact about your organisation]
- [Relevant constraints or priorities]
- [Strategic focus areas]

EVALUATION FRAMEWORKS:
1. [Framework name]: [How to apply it]
2. [Framework name]: [How to apply it]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[Define the sections and structure for each response]

[Disposition instruction — e.g. "Be critical. Find problems, not justifications."]
```

#### 4. Add Knowledge Sources (Optional)

Upload reference documents to give the agent additional context:

- Click "Knowledge" → "Upload files" → Select files
- Useful files: framework reference sheets, checklists, scenario guides

#### 5. Configure Conversation Style
- **Tone:** Match to your use case (professional, analytical, supportive, etc.)
- **Response length:** Detailed for analysis tasks; concise for quick queries
- **Web search:** Off if you want framework-based responses only

#### 6. Test the Agent

Click "Test" and submit a sample request. Verify the agent:
- Applies the frameworks correctly
- Uses the defined output format
- Takes the right disposition (critical, supportive, neutral, etc.)

#### 7. Publish & Share

- Click "Publish"
- Get a shareable link
- Share with colleagues or team members

---

## Option 2: Simple Prompt (No Account Needed)

### For Quick Use:

Paste your agent instructions into **any** AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot):

1. Open your preferred AI tool
2. Paste your full agent instructions at the start of the conversation
3. Submit your task or scenario

**Pros:**
- No setup required
- Works with free AI tools
- Immediate use

**Cons:**
- Not persistent (new conversation each time)
- Need to re-paste instructions for each session
- Can't share as a saved agent

---

## Option 3: GPT Custom Instructions (ChatGPT)

### For Persistent Use Across Sessions:

If you have ChatGPT Plus:

1. Go to ChatGPT Settings
2. Click "Personalization" → "Custom Instructions"
3. Under "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?", paste:

```
When I ask you to [perform your specific task], use this framework:

[PASTE YOUR AGENT INSTRUCTIONS HERE]

For all other questions, respond normally.
```

**Benefit:** Agent behaviour persists across all ChatGPT sessions

---

## Option 4: Claude Projects (Anthropic Claude)

### For Participants with Claude Pro:

1. Go to https://claude.ai
2. Click "Projects" → "New Project"
3. Name the project descriptively
4. In "Project Instructions", paste your agent prompt
5. Optionally upload reference documents as "Custom Instructions"

**Benefits:**
- Agent remembers context across conversations
- Can analyse multiple scenarios in one session
- Knowledge base persists between sessions

---

## Choosing the Right Option

| Situation | Recommended Option |
|---|---|
| Quick demo or one-off use | Option 2 (Simple Prompt) |
| Regular personal use, ChatGPT subscriber | Option 3 (Custom Instructions) |
| Regular personal use, Claude subscriber | Option 4 (Claude Projects) |
| Team or organisational use | Option 1 (Copilot Studio) |
| Sharing with colleagues | Option 1 (Copilot Studio) |

## Tips for Writing Effective Agent Instructions

### Be specific about role and context
The more precisely you define the agent's role and the context it operates in, the more useful its outputs will be. Generic instructions produce generic responses.

### Define the output format explicitly
If you want structured output (sections, tables, ratings, recommendations), spell out the exact format. Agents follow output templates reliably once defined.

### Set the disposition clearly
Tell the agent how to approach decisions: "be critical and find problems," "be constructive and find opportunities," "balance risk and benefit." This shapes the tone of every response.

### Test with representative scenarios
Before sharing or relying on an agent, test it with at least 3–5 representative inputs. Check whether it applies frameworks correctly and whether the output format is consistently useful.

### Iterate based on real use
After using the agent a few times, revisit the instructions. Common issues: output is too long, a framework step is being skipped, the tone is wrong. Small instruction changes make a big difference.

## What to Tell Colleagues About AI Agents

When introducing colleagues to a custom AI agent:

> "This is an AI agent built around a specific framework. It's not a special tool — it's a well-structured prompt. The agent applies defined criteria consistently, so it surfaces things you might miss and gives you a structured starting point for your own judgement.
>
> The agent informs your thinking; you make the final call."

Key points to emphasise:
- The agent applies frameworks, it doesn't replace expertise
- Outputs should be treated as a structured starting point, not a final answer
- The value is in consistency and coverage, not in certainty
- Human judgement remains essential, especially for context, nuance, and final decisions
