title: "Cognitive Offload and the 'AI Makes Us Dumber' Question"
---

## The Honest Version

I advocate for AI in education loudly and unapologetically. But advocacy without nuance is reckless.

So let's talk about the thing that worries academics most — the thing that, if we're being honest, should worry us a little too:

**Does AI reduce critical thinking?**

The concern goes like this: when students use AI, they stop doing the hard cognitive work. They offload the thinking that actually builds understanding. They get better outputs but develop weaker minds. Over time, AI doesn't make them smarter — it makes them dependent.

This isn't a fringe concern. There's genuine research behind it, and every educator who's watched a student paste a question into ChatGPT without pausing to think has felt the truth of it in their gut.

So: is it true?

The answer is more interesting than yes or no.

## What Cognitive Offload Actually Is

Cognitive offload is when you use an external tool to reduce the mental effort required for a task. You do it constantly:

- Writing a shopping list instead of memorising it
- Using a calculator instead of doing long division
- Checking a map instead of navigating from memory
- Setting a reminder instead of trying to remember

None of these make you "dumber." They free up cognitive resources for other things. The shopping list lets you think about recipes. The calculator lets you focus on the problem structure. The map lets you pay attention to traffic.

**AI is the latest — and most powerful — cognitive offload tool we've encountered.** And that's precisely why it feels different. Previous tools offloaded specific, well-defined tasks. AI can offload *thinking itself* — the drafting, the analysing, the reasoning, the evaluating.

That's what makes the question urgent.

---

## The Real Risk: Metacognitive Laziness

The concern isn't really about cognitive offload per se. It's about what happens to **metacognition** — the ability to monitor, evaluate, and regulate your own thinking.

When students use AI well, they:

- Generate a draft, then **evaluate** it against their own understanding
- Get AI feedback, then **decide** what to accept and what to reject
- Use AI to explore options, then **judge** which options make sense
- Read AI output, then **question** whether it's actually correct

When students use AI poorly, they:

- Generate a draft and submit it
- Get AI feedback and accept it
- Ask AI for the answer and copy it
- Read AI output and assume it's correct

The difference isn't whether they used AI. It's whether they **paused to think** about what AI gave them.

This is metacognitive laziness — not a failure of intelligence, but a failure of self-monitoring. The student stops asking "Do I understand this?" and starts asking "Does this look right?"

And yes, this is a genuine risk. Even when AI improves task performance, educators need to watch for it. Are students evaluating AI suggestions against their own understanding? Or just looping between "revise" and "ask ChatGPT" without ever pausing to think about *why*?

---

## But Here's What We're Getting Wrong

The metacognitive laziness risk is real. What's *not* justified is the leap from "this risk exists" to "AI makes us dumber."

That leap assumes something that deserves scrutiny: **that the way we've always learned is the only way learning works.**

### The "How I Learned" Bias

Many academics learned through:

- Rote memorisation
- Extensive worked examples
- Grinding through problems without assistance
- Long periods of solitary struggle
- Repetitive practice until concepts stuck

This worked. It built understanding, and the academics who went through it understandably value it. But when they see students *not* doing these things, they assume learning isn't happening.

That assumption is worth questioning.

### Learning Differently Isn't Learning Less

When a student uses AI to explore a concept, asks follow-up questions, gets confused, tries a different angle, and eventually builds understanding through an iterative conversation — that's learning. It doesn't look like sitting alone with a textbook for three hours, but it's engagement with material. And **engagement with material is learning**.

When a student uses AI to generate a first draft, then spends their time evaluating, restructuring, and improving it — they're learning. They're doing higher-order thinking (evaluation, synthesis) earlier in the process, even if they skipped some of the lower-order work (initial recall, basic comprehension).

When a student uses AI to get unstuck on a problem they'd otherwise abandon — they continue engaging with the material. Without AI, they might have given up entirely. With AI, they kept going. Which outcome produced more learning?

The question isn't whether students are doing the *same* cognitive work. It's whether they're doing *valuable* cognitive work. And the answer depends entirely on how they're using the tool — which brings us back to pedagogy.

---

## Learning Slower, Learning Different

Here's a reframe that might be more accurate than "AI reduces critical thinking":

**AI changes the path to understanding.**

Students might learn certain things more slowly when they use AI as a crutch for recall. But they might learn *other* things faster — like how to evaluate arguments, synthesise perspectives, and exercise judgement about quality.

Consider this analogy: when calculators became widespread, students stopped memorising multiplication tables as thoroughly. Some educators argued this was catastrophic. But students who used calculators could engage with more complex mathematical problems earlier — problems that would have been inaccessible if they'd had to do every calculation by hand.

Did calculators "make students dumber at arithmetic"? In some narrow sense, yes. Did calculators reduce mathematical capability overall? No — they redirected it. Students lost some computational fluency but gained access to higher-level mathematical thinking.

AI may be doing something similar at a much larger scale. Students may develop less capacity for certain types of unaided recall and composition. But they may develop *more* capacity for evaluation, judgement, synthesis, and critical analysis — if we design the learning to support that.

That "if" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. And it's entirely about pedagogy.

---

## Pedagogy Determines Everything

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **AI doesn't inherently support or weaken learning. Pedagogy does.**

The same AI tool can:

- **Undermine learning** if students use it to bypass thinking
- **Deepen learning** if students use it to extend thinking

The difference is how educators design the learning experience.

### Pedagogy That Weakens Learning with AI

- Assignments where the product is all that matters (submit the essay, get the grade)
- No requirement to explain process or reasoning
- Assessment that AI can complete without human input
- No reflection on what AI contributed vs. what the student contributed
- Treating AI use as binary (allowed/banned) rather than designing for thoughtful use

### Pedagogy That Strengthens Learning with AI

- **Process documentation:** Students show their AI conversation, explain their decisions, justify what they changed and why
- **Evaluation tasks:** Students assess AI output against criteria, identify errors, and improve it
- **Explanation requirements:** Students must explain their work orally or in writing, demonstrating understanding beyond what AI provided
- **Metacognitive prompts:** Built-in reflection points — "What did you understand before using AI? What do you understand now? Where did AI help? Where did it mislead you?"
- **Comparative tasks:** Students do a task without AI first, then with AI, then reflect on the differences
- **AI as interlocutor:** Students use AI as a thinking partner (conversation, not delegation) rather than an answer machine

The point is: the tool isn't the problem. How we integrate it into learning is what matters. And that's squarely within our control as educators.

## Toward Hybrid Intelligence

Maybe the framing of "AI vs. human thinking" is itself the problem.

What if the future isn't about preserving *unaided* human cognition in its traditional form, but about developing **hybrid intelligence** — the ability to think effectively in partnership with AI?

### What Hybrid Intelligence Looks Like

- Knowing when to think independently and when to think with AI
- Being able to evaluate AI output with genuine understanding
- Using AI to extend your capabilities without losing your foundation
- Maintaining metacognitive awareness while leveraging cognitive offload
- Developing judgement about *when* offloading is appropriate and when it's not

This isn't a lesser form of intelligence. It's a different — and arguably more relevant — form of intelligence for a world where AI is ubiquitous.

### The Symbiotic Relationship

The most effective AI users aren't those who delegate everything to AI, nor those who refuse to use it. They're the ones who've developed a **symbiotic relationship** — they know what they bring (context, judgement, values, experience) and what AI brings (breadth, speed, pattern recognition, tirelessness).

This symbiosis is itself a skill. It requires:

- Self-awareness about your own strengths and blind spots
- Understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations
- The discipline to pause and think before accepting AI output
- The humility to recognise when AI has a better perspective
- The confidence to override AI when your judgement says otherwise

If we teach students to develop this kind of relationship with AI, we're not weakening their thinking. We're preparing them for reality.

---

## The Conversation, Not Delegation Connection

This whole discussion circles back to a foundational principle: **conversation, not delegation.**

When students (or anyone) delegate to AI — "just give me the answer" — cognitive offload becomes cognitive abdication. They get output without understanding. Over time, their own capabilities erode.

When they converse with AI — "help me think through this" — cognitive offload becomes cognitive amplification. They engage with material at a deeper level, with AI as a thinking partner that challenges, extends, and enriches their understanding.

The difference between offload that harms and offload that helps is whether the human stays in the loop — not just approving output, but actively thinking alongside the tool.

## What We Should Actually Worry About

Instead of the broad fear that "AI makes us dumber," here are the specific, actionable concerns educators should focus on:

### 1. Loss of Productive Struggle

Some difficulty is pedagogically valuable. When students wrestle with a concept and eventually break through, that struggle builds durable understanding. If AI eliminates *all* struggle, it may eliminate the learning that comes with it.

**The response:** Design tasks where struggle is built in — where AI can help but can't shortcut the thinking. Require students to attempt problems before consulting AI, then reflect on what AI added.

### 2. Illusion of Understanding

Students may *feel* they understand something because they've read AI's clear explanation, without having built genuine comprehension. They can parrot the explanation but can't apply it to a new context.

**The response:** Test for transfer, not recall. Ask students to apply concepts to novel situations. Use oral assessments where they must explain reasoning in their own words.

### 3. Erosion of Foundational Skills

Some skills serve as foundations for higher-order thinking. If students skip the foundations (e.g., basic writing, mathematical reasoning, close reading), they may struggle with the complex tasks that depend on them.

**The response:** Be intentional about which foundations matter. Not every traditional skill is equally foundational. Identify the ones that truly underpin higher-order work and protect those — while being willing to let go of skills that technology has genuinely superseded.

### 4. Metacognitive Atrophy

The biggest risk: students stop monitoring their own understanding because AI gives them a false sense of competence.

**The response:** Build metacognitive practice into every AI-integrated activity. Regular reflection, self-assessment, and "explain your thinking" requirements. Make metacognition visible and valued.

---

## A More Honest Position

Here's where I land — and I think it's where thoughtful educators should land too:

**AI doesn't make us dumber. But it does make it easier to *be* dumber — to coast, to accept, to stop thinking.**

The same tool that can deepen understanding can also provide a comfortable path to intellectual laziness. The difference is pedagogy, self-awareness, and intentional practice.

Our job isn't to protect students from cognitive offload. It's to teach them to **offload wisely** — to know when to lean on AI and when to lean on their own minds, to maintain the metacognitive habits that turn AI from a crutch into a catalyst.

That's harder than banning AI. It's harder than embracing AI uncritically. It requires ongoing attention, honest reflection, and willingness to adapt our teaching as we learn more about how AI affects cognition.

But it's the honest position. And honest positions, in the long run, serve our students better than comforting certainties in either direction.

## Practical Takeaways

**For your teaching:**

- Design for process, not just product — make thinking visible
- Build in reflection points: "What did you understand before AI? After?"
- Test for transfer and explanation, not just correct answers
- Protect genuinely foundational skills while releasing obsolete ones
- Model your own symbiotic relationship with AI — show students how you think *with* it

**For your own practice:**

- Notice when you're offloading vs. when you're collaborating
- Regularly do hard thinking without AI to maintain your own foundations
- Use AI to extend your capabilities, not replace your engagement
- Stay curious about what students are actually learning, not just what they're producing

**For the conversation with colleagues:**

- Acknowledge the legitimate concerns — cognitive offload is real
- Shift from "AI makes us dumber" to "how do we design for thoughtful AI use?"
- Share what works — pedagogy that turns AI into a learning tool, not a shortcut
- Resist both uncritical enthusiasm and reflexive fear

---

## The Bottom Line

The question "Does AI make us dumber?" is the wrong question. The right questions are:

- **How do we design learning that leverages AI without bypassing thinking?**
- **What does effective human-AI collaboration look like, and how do we teach it?**
- **Which cognitive foundations must we protect, and which can we safely offload?**

These are pedagogical questions, not technological ones. And that means the answers are in our hands — the hands of educators, researchers, and professionals who understand both the technology and the humans using it.

AI is the most powerful cognitive tool we've ever given to learners. Whether it amplifies their thinking or atrophies it depends on us.

> **Cognitive offload isn't the enemy. Cognitive abdication is. And the difference is pedagogy.**
